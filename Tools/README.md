## Unpacking the game with the Asset Editor
 - In the asset editor, click Functions -> Unpack Game Assets -> navigate to "SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Hydroneer\Mining\Content\Paks", select the pak files and click open. In the next window select a folder to save the game files in, click open again, wait for the game to unpack
 - Note: The Asset Editor was not originally designed to work with this version of unreal and CAN NOT currently save files. If you wish to change existing assets you will need to edit the data in a hex editor. I use HxD
